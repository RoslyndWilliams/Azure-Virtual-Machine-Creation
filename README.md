<h1>Azure - Virtual Machine Creation</h1>
Azure is a cloud computing platform and an online portal that allows you to access and manage cloud services and resources provided by Microsoft. To get access to these resources and services, all you need to have is an active internet connection and the ability to connect to the Azure portal. This guide will demonstrate how to create an Azure account and create a virtual machine.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

- Computer with Internet Connection
- Credit Card (Required for free Azure credits)

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>


<h3>Step 1: Create an Azure Account</h3>


Create an Azure account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
- Select Start Free
- Follow the prompt to create the account 
     - You will need to put in your credit card information, but you will get $200 worth of Azure credit and will have 30 days to use those credits. You will not be charged until then
- Finish the prompt, click Go to Azure Portal, and you are ready to start with Azure!
     - You may also go to [portal.azure.com](https://www.portal.azure.com) to start
